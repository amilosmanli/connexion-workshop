# Connexion Workshop
Many of you have created a useful data model like recommendation system,
natural language processing, sentiment analysis model, or perhaps image
color recognition and wanted to expose outcome to the world in easy and
fast manner.

This workshop aims to give introduction to how to build a RESTful application
and how you can rapidly serve any data with a minimal effort. In this
interactive workshop we will cover how to build RESTful API using Zalando Connexion.
Connexion is a lightweight framework that uses Swagger specifications and Python
Flask to define and build APIs very rapidly.

By the end of this workshop you will be able to build RESTful API for
any data, that can serve high load, and scale on demand. If you are familiar
with Python, this workshop will show you how to use basic coding skills to
develop production ready project. Bring your laptop and code alongside, or if you
got any questions regarding REST, Swagger specs and Python Connexion, you can
join the workshop too.
